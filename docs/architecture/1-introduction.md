# 1\. Introduction

This document outlines the overall project architecture for Tea & Snacks Delivery Aggregator, including backend systems, shared services, and non-UI specific concerns. Its primary goal is to serve as the guiding architectural blueprint for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency and adherence to chosen patterns and technologies.

**Relationship to Frontend Architecture:**
If the project includes a significant user interface, a separate Frontend Architecture Document will detail the frontend-specific design and MUST be used in conjunction with this document. Core technology stack choices documented herein (see "Tech Stack") are definitive for the entire project, including any frontend components.
