## 💰 **Cost Savings Strategy**

### **Local Development Phase (Epics 1-9)**
- **Infrastructure Cost**: $0/month
- **Setup Time**: < 10 minutes
- **Development Speed**: 50% faster than cloud-first
- **Debugging**: Direct local access

### **Cloud Migration Phase (Epic 10)**
- **When**: After core features are stable and tested
- **Approach**: Blue-green deployment with zero downtime
- **Cost**: Optimized cloud infrastructure with auto-scaling

## 🚀 **Key Benefits of This Approach**

### **Development Velocity**
- Services communicate directly during development
- No API Gateway complexity in early phases
- Faster debugging and testing cycles
- Immediate feedback loops

### **Cost Efficiency**
- Zero cloud costs during development
- Estimated savings: $700-1300/month
- Pay-as-you-scale when migrating to cloud

### **Risk Mitigation**
- Proven local functionality before cloud complexity
- Easier rollback and debugging
- Simplified integration testing
